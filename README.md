### First steps

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

```
composer require broadcastt/broadcastt-php-http
```

### Configuration

```php
$appId = 'YOUR_APP_ID';
$appKey = 'YOUR_APP_KEY';
$appSecret = 'YOUR_APP_SECRET';
$appCluster = 'YOUR_APP_CLUSTER';

$client = new Broadcastt\BroadcasttClient( $appId, $appKey, $appSecret, $appCluster );
// or
$client = Broadcastt\BroadcasttClient::fromUri("http://{$appKey}:{$appSecret}@{$appCluster}.broadcastt.xyz/apps/{$appId}");
```

#### `appId` (Integer)

The id of the application

#### `appKey` (String)

The key of the application

#### `appSecret` (String)

The secret of the application

#### `appCluster` (String) Optional

The cluster of the application

Default value: `eu`

### Modifiers

#### `scheme` (String)

E.g. http or https

Default value: `http`

#### `host` (String)

The host e.g. cluster.broadcastt.xyz. No trailing forward slash

Default value: `eu.broadcasttapp.xyz` If the cluster is not set during initialization

#### `port` (String)

The http port

Default value: `80`

#### `basePath` (String)

The base of the path what the request will call. `{appId}` can be used to automatically parse the app ID in the base path.

Default value: `/apps/{appId}`

#### `timeout` (String)

The http timeout

Default value: `30`

#### `guzzleClient` (Mixed[])

Guzzle Client for sending HTTP requests

If not set it will be initialized without any parameters on the first request

### Helpers

#### `fromUri($uri)`

Instantiate a new client from the given uri.

These are methods which help you modify the instance

#### `useCluster($cluster)`

Modifies the `host` value for given `cluster`

#### `encrypted()`

Short way to change `scheme` to `https` and `port` to `443`

### Usage

#### `trigger($channels, $name, $data, $socketId = null, $jsonEncoded = false)`

Trigger an event by providing event name and payload.

Optionally provide a socket ID to exclude a client (most likely the sender).

#### `triggerBatch($batch = [], $encoded = false)`

Trigger multiple events at the same time.

#### `get($path, $params = [])`

GET arbitrary REST API resource using a synchronous http client.

All request signing is handled automatically.
